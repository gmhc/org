George Mason High School Hack Club organization documentation.

Throughout this document, the George Mason High School Hack Club will be referred to as "the club."

## Association

The club is a chapter of [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com).

## Leadership

At all times the club will be led by the three most qualified members. As of early 2017, the leadership is composed of:

* [Erik Boesen](https://github.com/ErikBoesen)
* [Bella Hubble](https://github.com/BellaHubble)
* [Tristan Charpentier](https://github.com/hashFactory)

### Decision making

The group of three leaders can vote on all club decisions. In the absence of one leader, the club sponsor can act as a tiebreaker. In the absence of the team sponsor, all members will take a majority vote to break the tie.

## Meetings

Meetings will be held every Wednesday (barring an unexpected emergency) in Mr. Knight's room, A130\. At standard meetings, newer students can work on a [Hack Club Workshop](https://workshops.hackclub.com) of their choice at the meeting or on a project relating to the month's theme (detailed below).

On Short Wednesdays, Hackathons will held from the end of school (12:45) to the Late Bus at 4:30. At 4:00, participants can start showing off their creations to the three leaders, who will vote at the end of the meeting on a winner. Whichever project recieves the most votes will be declared the winner of the hackathon, and its creator will be awarded a free .tech domain (limit one per person) through Hack Club.

## Themes

Each month will have a new theme. The theme can be a new programming language or a broader concept like "functional programming," or "websites." It can also be something specific like "Python Flask webservers." The goal of setting a monthly theme is to encourage members to work together to discover as much as they can about a technology.
